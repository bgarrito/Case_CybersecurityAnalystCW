### 2. Challenge Objective
This challenge is divided into two parts: **Homework** and **AI Live Coding**.

#### **Homework**
Your task is to analyze a provided set of network traffic data and identify potential security risks. A detailed and in-depth data analysis is required. The information and insights gathered during this step will be critical for the **AI Live Coding** session, so ensure you have a strong understanding of the data provided. We are looking for:
- Comprehensive data analysis.
- Logical reasoning in identifying risks.
- Clear and actionable insights.

#### **AI Live Coding**
Using the analysis and insights from your Homework, you will be asked to write code live during a 20-minute session. It is mandatory to use an LLM (Large Language Model) agent to assist in the development process. This step will assess your ability to apply insights from the Homework to implement solutions in real time.
